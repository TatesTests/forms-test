Please keep file size under 2MB.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TIPS &amp; TRICKS</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Animation Length</em></p>\n\n<p>Lengthy animations make for larger file sizes. Allow repeating elements to loop instead of adding extra frames to the timeline.</p>\n\n<p><em>Static and Dynamic Pixels</em></p>\n\n<p>The file size for animated GIFs increases with the amount of pixels that change within the animation. Building a <a href=\"http://cinemagraphs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cinemagraph</a> animation that focuses on key moving parts across a larger static image can reduce file size while delivering the impact of a fully-animated sequence.</p>\n\n<p><em>Frame Rate</em></p>\n\n<p>Reducing frame rate on animations with video content can significantly reduce file size while remaining fluid in appearance. Frame rate can be adjusted within the nested upper-right icon of the Timeline palette (Window/Timeline will toggle palette visibility).</p>\n\n<p><em>Color &amp; Export Settings</em></p>\n\n<p>The export color for animated GIFs should always remain at the maximum (256) though additional export settings can be adjusted to get the desired look. Adjusting the lossy setting is a quick option for reducing file size with minimal loss in quality.</p>\n",
